        // - "@(llm.response("ResourceID"))"
        // - "@(llm.prompt("ResourceID"))"
        //
        // To use these in your resource, you can define a local variable as follows:
        //
        // local llmResponse = "@(llm.response("ResourceID"))"
        // You can then access the value with "@(llmResponse)".
        //
        // The "@(...)" syntax enables lazy evaluation, ensuring that values are
        // retrieved only after the result is ready.
        //
        // Note: Each resource is restricted to a single dedicated action. Combining multiple
        // actions within the same resource is not allowed.

                Without prefacing it with anything, giving explanations or justifications, present a concise,
                plain-language summary of the dining options based on the data provided. Write in three or more
                paragraphs, focusing on Comfort Food Spots: Suggest restaurants offering hearty meals or seasonal dishes
                suitable for colder or rainy weather. Outdoor Dining: Recommend caf√©s with heated terraces if the
                weather is chilly but dry. Seasonal Specials: Include options like hot chocolate, mulled wine, or winter
                desserts for cold days. Ensure the language is simple and easy to understand. Use plain text, with no
                line breaks. The data is as follows:

                @(llm.response("llmWeatherReport"))
                """

                // Specify if the LLM response should be a structured JSON

                // If JSONResponse is true, then the structured JSON data will need to have the
                // following keys.
                JSONResponseKeys {}
