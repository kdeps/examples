        // local llmResponse = "@(llm.response("ResourceID"))"
        // You can then access the value with "@(llmResponse)".
        //

        // retrieved only after the result is ready.

        // actions within the same resource is not allowed.

                Without prefacing it with anything, giving explanations or justifications, present a concise,
                plain-language summary of the weather conditions based on the data from the JSON file.
                In 3 or more paragraph, focus on reporting the key weather details, such as temperature, precipitation,
                and wind, in a way that is simple and easy to understand. Explicitly mentioning the city and country,
                based on the provided input. Just plain text. New lines and line breaks are not allowed. Avoid any
                technical or structural descriptions of the JSON object. The JSON data is as follows:

                @(client.responseBody("HTTPClient"))
                """

                // Specify if the LLM response should be a structured JSON
                JSONResponse = false

                // If JSONResponse is true, then the structured JSON data will need to have the
                // following keys.
                JSONResponseKeys {}

                // Specify the files that this LLM will process.
                files {
                        // "@(request.files()[0])"
                }

                // Timeout duration in seconds. This specifies when to terminate the llm session.
                timeoutDuration = 60.s
        }
